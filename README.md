# Clustering-Bank-Customers

## Overview

This project aims to categorize customers of bank accounts using advanced unsupervised learning techniques. By leveraging various methodologies and tools, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns within the data and effectively segment customers into distinct categories.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Employ advanced unsupervised learning techniques to categorize customers based on their banking behavior.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods such as the Elbow method, Silhouette score, statistical gap analysis, and hierarchical clustering.
- Validate clustering results and explore dependencies among clusters using ANOVA tests.
- Visualize each step of the process using t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for enhanced understanding and interpretation.
